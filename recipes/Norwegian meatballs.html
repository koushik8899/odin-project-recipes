        <h3>Both of my parents are Norwegian. Growing up, my mom used to make these meatballs. Later in life, my dad took over the meal prep, and he became a great cook. My mom did a good job, but my dad perfected the recipe. I think of him every time I make them now.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
            <li>½ cup milk</li>

            <li>1 large onion, grated</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 pounds 85% lean ground beef</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h4>Step1</h4>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a jelly roll pan.
        
                </p></li>
                <li><h4>Step2</h4>
                    <p>Combine bread crumbs, milk, eggs, onion, ginger, salt, nutmeg, garlic, and black pepper in a mixing bowl. Let stand until bread crumbs absorb milk, about 5 minutes. Stir until just mixed and add ground beef. Mix until well blended. Shape mixture into 1-inch meatballs and place on the prepared pan.
            
                    </p></li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>step3</h4>
                        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 18 minutes. Set meatballs aside</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Step4</h4>
                        <p>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in flour and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Slowly add broth; cook and stir gravy until smooth and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Blend in cream, cayenne pepper, and black pepper.</p>

                        <p>Gently stir cooked meatballs into gravy and heat through, but do not boil, about 5 minutes more.
